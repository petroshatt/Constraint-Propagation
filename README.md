# Constraint-Propagation-CP
Project 1 for Constraint Programming course. Using three consistency techniques on sudoku and greater-than-sudoku problems, implemented in Python.
1. Arc Consistency (variation of AC-3, storing variables in queue)
2. Restricted Path Consistency (RPC-1 algorithm)
3. Neighborhood Singleton Arc Consistency (NSACQ algorithm)
